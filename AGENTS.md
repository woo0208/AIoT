# Project Instructions

## Scope
- Modify only the issue explicitly requested in the current task.
- Do not refactor or edit unrelated code.
- If another issue is discovered, report it without fixing it unless requested.

## Research integrity
- Preserve the definitions of M0, M1, and M2 unless the task explicitly targets them.
- Do not change seeds, folds, feature definitions, labels, preprocessing, or evaluation rules unless explicitly requested.
- Do not tune code to reproduce or improve a desired accuracy.
- Experimental results are evidence, not targets.

## Data and results
- Never fabricate or infer experiment results when the required datasets are unavailable.
- Synthetic data may be used only for structural/unit tests.
- Clearly distinguish structural tests from actual research-data results.

## Editing
- Prefer the smallest patch that solves the requested problem.
- Do not automatically commit or push.
- Report every modified file and the exact behavior changed.

## Verification
- Run relevant tests after changes.
- Preserve existing tests unless the requested change intentionally alters their assumptions.
- Report which tests were actually run and whether they passed.
